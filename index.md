## Welcome
Welcome to the OWASP Sydney Chapter home page!

The OWASP Sydney Chapter was active in 2019 and is being rebooted in 2020. We organise local events throughout the year.

The chapter leaders are Ric Campo, Jack Gifford, and Sherry Liu.


## Our Goals
***Equality*** <br/>
We aim to bring together people from research, academia and industry to motivate, and empower others to pursue a career in cybersecurity. By raising awareness against discrimination within the workforce, we work towards increasing diversity and equality in cybersecurity.

***Education*** <br/>
We are committed to helping discover the next generation of cybersecurity talent. We aim to offer mentorship programs to educate those new to cybersecurity, and provide talks from industry professionals to showcase all cybersecurity has to offer.

***Community*** <br/>
We want to help you connect with like-minded individuals. Whether you are new to cybersecurity or a seasoned veteran, our goal is to build a community where everyone can openly discuss and explore current issues in cybersecurity, employment opportunities and more. By providing networking opportunities, we want everyone to get involved in the community and establish relationships with new people.

***Workshops*** <br/>
No cybersecurity summit would be complete without CTF events! We aim to hold an annual end of year competition where participants compete for a shot at glory and a cash prize.
